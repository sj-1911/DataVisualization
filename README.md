## 🚦 Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) Data Project  

This project focuses on analyzing traffic data from the Florida Department of Transportation to uncover insights into **traffic patterns**, **vehicle types**, and **roadway conditions**. It showcases the **end-to-end data analysis process**, from cleaning and sorting raw data to creating meaningful visualizations.  

### ✨ Key Features  
- **Data Sorting and Cleaning**:  
  Organized datasets by date, location, and traffic volume while addressing missing and inconsistent data.  
- **Visualizations**:  
  - Line charts to show traffic trends over time.  
  - Bar charts for location-based comparisons.  
  - Heatmaps to identify peak traffic periods.  
- **Tools and Libraries**:  
  - 🐍 **Python**: Core language for data analysis.  
  - 📊 **Pandas**: For preprocessing and sorting data.  
  - 📈 **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: To craft insightful visualizations.

# 📈 Predicting Mental Health Care Trends

This project is designed to **predict mental health care usage trends** over time using a **Random Forest Regressor**. By applying machine learning to time-series data, the model provides insights into future usage patterns, which could assist policymakers, healthcare providers, and researchers in planning mental health resources.

## 🛠️ Key Features of the Project

### 1. **Data Preparation**  
- Loaded and cleaned a CSV dataset containing `Time Period` and `Value` columns.  
- Converted time-series data into numeric format and handled missing or invalid values.  
- Sorted the dataset by `Time Period` to ensure proper sequential ordering.

### 2. **Model Training**  
- Used a **Random Forest Regressor** to train a predictive model on the dataset.  
- Split the data into training and testing sets using an 80/20 split ratio.  
- Evaluated the model’s performance using metrics:  
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
  - **R² Score**

### 3. **Visualization**  
- Generated scatter plots comparing **actual values vs. predicted values** for better interpretability of the model’s performance.  
- Highlighted predicted trends for future mental health care usage.

### 4. **Outcome**  
- Predicted the **next month’s mental health care usage** based on historical data.  
- Visualized key insights to aid in understanding trends over time.
