Data Visualization


This repository contains various data visualization projects developed as part of coursework in Data Analytics. The primary project showcased here involves sorting, cleaning, and visualizing data from the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT).

ðŸš¦ Florida Department of Transportation Data Project
Overview
In this project, FDOT data was analyzed to gain insights into traffic patterns, vehicle types, and roadway conditions. The dataset required significant preprocessing, including handling missing values, sorting data by key variables, and filtering specific time periods for analysis.

Key Steps
Data Sorting:
The raw FDOT dataset was sorted by variables such as date, location, and traffic volume to facilitate efficient analysis.
Data Cleaning:
Removed invalid entries and handled missing or inconsistent data points.
Data Visualization:
Used various visualization techniques to present insights clearly, including:
Line charts to show traffic volume trends over time.
Bar charts for comparing traffic at different locations.
Heatmaps to highlight peak traffic periods.
Tools and Libraries Used
Python: For data processing and analysis.
Pandas: For sorting and cleaning the dataset.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating detailed visualizations.
